# Proxmox Webhook Notification to Discord

Due to the character limit of discord webhooks (2000 characters) you can't send full backup logs into discord so this program will act as a middle man and store the log file and make it accessible via a link that will be posted in the discord instead of the wall of text being posted in the channel directly.

```
// Method/URL:
POST http://url-to-webserver/webhook

// Headers:
Content-Type: application/json

// Body:
{
    "discordWebhook": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/{{ secrets.token }}",
    "messageContent": "{{ escape message }}",
    "messageTitle": "{{ title }}",
    "urlLogAccessible": "http://url-to-webserver/logs/"
}

//Secrets:
token: 70043953045676504/5E8qbiWN4o-sdagsdgfgdfgdfhfghjrrety_adadsdadsadasdasds-izpAdw
```
